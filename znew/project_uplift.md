		- [x] This reasoning is the same as the recommendation that¬†[CSS classes not be named](https://blog.logrocket.com/5-things-to-consider-when-creating-your-css-style-guide-7b85fa70039d/)¬†==for the style they apply, but rather the meaning of the style ‚Ää‚Äî ‚Ääi.e., don‚Äôt call it¬†`redAndBold`, but rather¬†`activeMenuItem`.==
		- [x] ==Another aspect of mutations that contributes to their transactional nature is that they are intended to be pure functions. Mutations are intended to receive input only via their payload and to not produce side effects elsewhere. While actions get a full context to work with, mutations only have the¬†`state`¬†and the¬†`payload`.==
		- [x] ==To ensure this doesn‚Äôt happen, always remember that actions should also serve a functional role. If what your action does can be done with a simple mutation, keep it like that. Only use actions when your state-changing code:==
			 -  Outgrows a mutation
			 -  Requires committing a few mutations in certain order
			 -  Deals with async code
