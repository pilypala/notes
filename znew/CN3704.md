- [ ] CN3704
	- [ ] constant current set by external resistor
	- [ ] constant voltage charging sets voltages at 16.8V
	- [ ] deeply discharged battery, chip charges at 15% of the current set by resistor
	- [ ] charges finished at current set by external resistor
	- [ ] when voltage drops below 16v, a new charging cycle begins
	- [ ] when Vin drops below battery voltage, chip enters sleep mode
