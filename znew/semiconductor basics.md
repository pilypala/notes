[How to REMEMBER what you read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-vjo96n2JM&t=218s)
1. ask quirky questions on the material and use them on anki
2.QandA form
3. atomic questions

## [How a MOSFET Works - with animation! | Intermediate Electronics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfvyj88Hs_o)

### [How does a diode work - the PN Junction (with animation) | Intermediate Electronics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2S7kN12RDQ&list=PLfYdTiQCV_p7sDswtLZKK43BWOd2mTmHC)
1. undoped intrinsic semiconductor material, free electron and holes are equal.
2. pentavalent doped -> n type,
3. trivalent doped -> p type

#### Band Gap and Semiconductor Current Carriers | Intermediate Electronics
1. protons, neutrons and electrons
2. electron energy levels -> shells
3. outter most shell valent shell
4. valent bond electron can receive energy and goes to conduction band
5. solid crystal material formed by covalent bonds

### What is a diode? A simple animated overview | Basic Electronics
1. PANIC (positive is anode, negative is cathode)
2. general diode -> miliamps to 1A
3. power diode -> amps and up
4. shockie diode and zener diode

5. forword voltage and reverse voltage

### How does a diode work - the PN Junction (with animation) | Intermediate Electronics
1. conduction band electroncs combine with holes in valence band
![[depletion region.png]]
2. energy levels in p and n semiconductors

### How does a forward biased diode work at the molecular level? - Part 2 | Intermediate Electronics
1. overcome barrier, electrons lost enrergy to combine with holes
2. energy band diagram

[# PN Junction Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHA4teZmwT0)
1. Bound ions
2. current happens in conduction band in n, valence band in p
