- Vgs is like a valve gate width
- Vds water pressure
- At small Vds, Vgs determines how much current goes through, thus the omhic or linear or triode region
- Vp is between -5V and -2V
- With Vgs at zero, only increasing Vds, it gets to a point where Vds = Vp. Causing the Vdg to be at Vp, pinching off at the drain end. At this point, Current stays independent of Vds and is only a function of Vgs! Device enters saturation mode or pinch off region
- At Vgs <= Vp, JFET ceases to conduct current, it is at cutoff mode


### triode region
- both Vgs and Vgd > Vp and both reverse biased, therefore both < 0
- both ends are not pinched off, so channel acts as a resistor with resistance controlled by Vgs


### pinch-off region, or staturated region
-  0 > Vgs > Vp, so not pinched off at source end
-  Vgd < Vp < 0, pinched off at drain end
-  Current is dependent of Vds, only dependent of Vgs
