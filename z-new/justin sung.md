"Commit or Quit" is Toxic Summary:
1. Commit or Quit promotes trying harder, no matter what. This is flawed because trying harder when the result doesn’t work for you is insane. 
2. In most situations it’s not that you’re not trying harder. It’s that the actual direction and process and way the effort is being utilized is false
3. Trying so hard that you’re livelihood and mental health is damaged means effort isn’t the issue

What we should do:
1. Find the plan of least resistance
2. Create a system to create good habits
3. Use only willpower for a spark of change and start habits
4. Consistency will get us to where you want to be
