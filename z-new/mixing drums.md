#### **Possible mic configurations**

How many mics you use – and where you place them – depends on the style of music you’re recording and how many inputs you have on your audio interface.   

If you have **1 input**, put the mic overhead to capture as much of the kit as possible (not too close; try a height of about 42 inches from the center of the snare).

If you have **2 inputs**, you can mic:

1.  Bass drum and use one overhead mic (most common), or…
2.  Bass drum and snare (less common, and best for R&B and styles where you’ll be mostly using kick/snare/hi-hat and less cymbals), or…
3.  Snare and 1 room mic (for certain types of jazz and styles with less bass drum), or…
4.  Use _The Recorderman Technique,_ which means putting up 2 overheads at a close distance (remember to measure to avoid phasing).

If you have **4 inputs,** mic the bass drum and snare and use 2 overheads.

If you have **6 inputs**, you can mic:

1.  Bass drum, snare, 2 overheads, floor tom, 1 room mic, or…
2.  Bass drum, snare, 2 overheads, floor tom and 1 rack tom. This works for 4-piece kits. If you have more toms but not enough inputs, avoid putting a mic on one rack tom and not the other.

If you have **8 inputs:** bass drum, snare, 2 overheads, 3 toms, 1 room mic.

If you have **more than 8 inputs:**  bass drum, snare, hi-hat, 2 overheads, 3 or more toms, 1 room mic.
