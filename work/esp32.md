ESP32-WROOM-32D

ESP32-WROOM-32U has U.F.L connector
[32U vs 32UE - ESP32 Forum](https://www.esp32.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=14308)

	The two modules are pin-to-pin compatible. The main difference is that ESP32-WROOM-32UE integrates ESP32 ECO V3 chip, and has enhanced security boot and flash encryption. You can find more details about ESP32 ECO V3 here in our news letter:

ESP32-WROOM-32
	- old chip, not recommended for old design
	- ESP32-D0WDQ6
	
	The biggest difference between the `WROOM` and the `WROVER` chips is that the `WROVER` integrates an `8 MB` "SPI PSRAM" chip on the module along with the `ESP32-D0WDQ6`. The specs and features of the various ESP32 modules are described in a table at the top of the [ESP32 Modules and Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules) section of the [ESP32 Hardware Reference](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/hw-reference/index.html).
