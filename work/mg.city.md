	Let’s take the example of a plate with a number of tapped holes. The process for adding these holes during manufacture is to drill the tap holes first and then add the thread using a tap. As the thread is defined by the tap tool, there is no need to model the thread. All we need to know is what thread should be applied and ensure this is annotated on the 2D drawing. This example lends itself perfectly for use with a cosmetic thread.
