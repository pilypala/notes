	- [ ] ==band gap==, energy between valence band and conduction band
		- [ ] conduction band and valence band in conductor has no band gap
	- [ ] solid crystal material formed by covalent bonds
		- [ ] in heated instrinstic silicon crystal, electrons escape to conduction band, leaving holes in valence band
		- [ ] electron current in conduction band
		- [ ] hole current in valence band

	- [ ] undoped intrinsic semiconductor material, free electron and holes are equal.
	- [ ] doping increase conductivity
	- [ ] ==pentavalent doped -> n type==
	- [ ] ==trivalent doped -> p type==

	- [ ] n type has more electrons and p type has more holes
	- [ ] at the boundary diffusion happens holes combined with electrons
	- [ ] boundary at p type material becomes negatively charged due to electrons from n-type
	- [ ] electric field at the depletion region repels further electron diffusion to p-type. Note p and n regions are charge neutral. Electric field is only in depletion region between positive and negative charges and the direction is opposing electrons in n region.

	- [ ] energy levels in p and n semiconductors
		- [ ] in n-type excess electrons got pushed to conduction band and electrons *n*nbecome majority carriers
		- [ ] in p-type lack of electrons leave holes in valence bond and holes become majority carriers
		- [ ] energy levels of the valence and conduction bands in n-type material are lower than those of the p-type
