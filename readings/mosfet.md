	- [ ] Transistors are called transistors because it's short for "transconductance resistor". Transconductance means putting a voltage in gets you a current out (Iout/Vin, the opposite of a resistor which is Vout/Iin).

	- [ ] Unlike virtually every other active device, the power MOSFET is unusual in that its schematic symbol includes a parasitic device â€“ the body diode.

		- [ ] The intrinsic body diode is the p-n junction between the body and the drain. In a discrete (standalone) MOSFET, the source and body are usually tied together for convenience to make a three-pin package. This means there's a diode between the source and drain:
