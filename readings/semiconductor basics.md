* S and D are at equal or higher than the substrate (reverse biased)

### What is a diode? A simple animated overview | Basic Electronics
1. PANIC (positive is anode, negative is cathode)
2. general diode -> miliamps to 1A
3. power diode -> amps and up
4. shockie diode and zener diode
![[shockie diode and zener diode.png]]

5. forword voltage and reverse voltage



### How does a forward biased diode work at the molecular level? - Part 2 | Intermediate Electronics
1. overcome barrier, electrons lost enrergy to combine with holes
2. energy band diagram

[# PN Junction Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHA4teZmwT0)
1. Bound ions
2. current happens in conduction band in n, valence band in p
